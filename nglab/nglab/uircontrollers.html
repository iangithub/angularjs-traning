    <h1>Understanding Controllers</h1>
    <p>In Angular, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope.

When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function. A new child scope will be created and made available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope.

If the controller has been attached using the controller as syntax then the controller instance will be assigned to a property on the new scope.
